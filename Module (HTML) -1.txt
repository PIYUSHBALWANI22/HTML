Q.1)Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

-->HTML elements and tags are a lot different. Let’s see what HTML elements and Tags actually are and their differences.

HTML Tags: The starting and ending point parts of an HTML document are HTML Tags, which start with < (less than) and end with >(greater than) angle bracket, and whatever is written inside the angle brackets are known as tags.

Both opening and closing tags must be there in order to function. There are also some self enclosing tags which require only one tag such as <hr>, <img>, <br> etc. The ending slash over here is optional.

HTML Elements: Elements in HTML enclose the content in between the tags. It consists of an expression or a structure. Its architecture consists of a start tag, content followed by an ending tag.

Example:<b> This is the content. </b>
This example shows the use of HTML Elements in the code.


Q.2)What are tags and attributes in HTML?

-->HTML Tags: HTML tags are the keywords that are used to produce web pages in various formats. Opening tags and closing tags are found in the majority of tags. The concluding tags contain a forward slash (/), while the language of the beginning tags is the same. Certain tags don’t need to be closed.

HTML attributes:Attributes are the way authors have to define properties for an element. These properties usually change the way a browser interpret the element, by changing its meaning or presentation. For example, the <a> element inserts a link in the document, but the rel attribute states the relationship between the current document (the one containing the link) and the destination resource (the one the link is pointing to).

Many of the attributes in HTML5, the ones known as global attributes, are available for all elements in the standard. But most elements have also a set of specific attributes that are only available or specifically adapted for them.

Q.3)What are void elements in HTML? 

-->Most of the HTML elements are surrounded by start and end tags to specify the starting and end of the element.

There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements. Void elements doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional. Example of such elements are <br>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <link>, <base>, <meta>, <param>, <area>, <embed>, <col>, <track>, <source> etc.



Q.4)What are HTML Entities?

-->HTML provides some method to display reserved characters. Reserved characters are those characters that are either reserved for HTML or those which are not present in the basic keyboard. For instance, ‘<‘ is reserved in HTML language.

HTML entities are pieces of text that begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). They are used to display characters that have special meaning in HTML, such as <, >, or &. For example, to display a less than sign (<), you can use the entity &lt;. You can also use entities to display symbols, shapes, or mathematical operators.

Q.5)What are different types of lists in HTML?

-->Unordered List
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default.

For example:
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

Ordered List
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default.

For example:
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

Description Lists
HTML also supports description lists.

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.

The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term.

For example:
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>


Q.6)What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?

-->In HTML, the "class" selector is used to select an element with a specific class attribute. The class selector starts with a period (.) followed by a class name. Unlike the id selector, we can attach multiple selector to an HTML element. Therefore, the class can be applied many time within a page. The important point to note about the class selector is that the class name must not be started with a number.

->The class is an attribute that specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.
->The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
->The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the specified class name.


Q.7)What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements?

-->In HTML, both Id and Class are the element selector and are used to identify an element based on the name assign to these parameters. ID and Class selectors are the most widely used element selectors in CSS (HTML). The basic difference between ID and Class is that the ID selector is applied only to one element in a page, whereas the class selector can be applied to several elements on a single page.


Q.8)What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

-->HTML formatting tags are elements that are used to change the appearance or meaning of text on a web page. There are two types of formatting tags: "physical tags" and "logical tags". Physical tags change the style of the text, such as making it bold or italic. Logical tags add semantic value to the text, such as indicating that it is a heading or a keyword.

Some examples of physical tags are `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italic, `<u>` for underline, `<small>` for smaller text, etc. Some examples of logical tags are `<h1>` for heading level 1, `<em>` for emphasis, `<strong>` for strong importance, `<mark>` for marked text, etc.

Q.9)How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?

-->Cellpadding:

Cellpadding specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell.

The default cellpadding value is 1.
Cellpadding is widely used and considered to be an effective mean.
Cellpadding is an attribute.

Cellspacing:

Cellspacing specifies the space between cells (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the edges of the adjacent cells.

Whereas, the default cellspacing value is 2.
Cellspacing is less effective than Cellpadding.
Cellspacing is also an attribute.


Q.10)How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?

-->To merge cells in an HTML table, you can use the colspan and rowspan attributes in the <td> tag. The colspan attribute specifies how many columns a cell should span, and the rowspan attribute specifies how many rows a cell should span. For example, to merge two cells in the first row, you can write:

<td colspan="2">Merged cell</td>


Q.11)What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

-->Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

-> Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.



Q.12)How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?

-->To create a hyperlink in HTML, you can use the <a> element. The <a> element stands for “anchor,” and it is used to create a hyperlink to another web page or a specific location on the same page. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the "href" attribute, which indicates the link’s destination. The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader. Clicking on the link text will send the reader to the specified URL address.


Q.13)What is the use of an iframe tag? 

-->The iframe in HTML stands for Inline Frame. The "iframe" tag defines a rectangular region within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and borders. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. The HTML iframe name attribute is used to specify a reference for an <Iframe> element.The iframe is basically used to show a webpage inside the current web page. The ‘ src ‘ attribute is used to specify the URL of the document that occupies the iframe.


Q.14)What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

-->The span tag is an HTML element that is used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document, that does not have any specific meaning or rendering. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. The span tag is an inline element, which means it does not create a new line of content, unlike the div tag, which is a block-level element.

For example, you can use the span tag to color a particular part of a text:

<p>My brother has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>


Q.15)How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?

-->There are different ways to insert a picture into a background image of a web page. One way is to use the CSS "background-image" property and specify the URL or path of the image. Another way is to use the HTML "background" attribute in the body tag and pass the URL or path of the image.


Q.16)How are active links different from normal links?

-->A normal link is a line of code that points to another resource, such as a web page or an image. An active link is a normal link that is being interacted with by the user, such as by clicking or hovering over it. Active links can have different styles or colors than normal links to indicate their state. For example, you can use CSS to make active links red and underline.


Q.17)What are the different tags to separate sections of text? 

--><br> tag - Usually <br> tag is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the flow to the next line.

    <p> tag - The <p> tag contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.


Q.18)What is SVG?

-->SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
    SVG is used to define graphics for the Web.
    SVG is a W3C recommendation.

The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics.

SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.



Q.19)What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

-->HTML and XHTML are both markup languages used to create web pages, but XHTML has a stricter syntax and follows XML rules. XHTML requires well-formed code with properly nested tags and attributes, while HTML is more forgiving of syntax errors. XHTML is more compatible with different devices and browsers than HTML.


Q.20)What are logical and physical tags in HTML?

-->Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better visibility and understanding of the text by the user on the web page. However, both tags differ from each other as suggested by their names.

Physical Tags:

Physical Tags are used in HTML to provide actual physical formatting to the text. Following are the Physical tags commonly used in HTML:
<b>	Defines bold text
<i>	Defines italic text
<big> Defines big text

Logical Tags :

Logical Tags are used in HTML to display the text according to the logical styles. Following are the Logical tags commonly used in HTML:

<abbr>	Defines an abbreviation
<q>	Defines short quotation
<strong>	Defines strong text
